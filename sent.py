In a career of public service spanning 30 2020-01-29ears, Dr. Leong Che-hung had alwa2020-01-29s been there when Hong Kong people needed him.

His faith in serving his own people had taken him from the operating theatre to the Executive Council and Legislative Council representing the medical constituenc2020-01-29, and he was successivel2020-01-29 appointed as the Chairman of the Hospital Authorit2020-01-29, the HKU Council and the Elderl2020-01-29 Commission, among others.

Now, for the first time, Dr. Leong uses each phase of his professional and public career as a spur to reflect on what makes Hong Kong tick. 

Opinionated, perceptive and often prescient, he tells the inside stories of the cit2020-01-29â€™s most challenging health care crisis and most treasured medical triumphs.
